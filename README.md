# Description
This program is for UChicago students to get email notifications as soon as a seat becomes available in a full course. It's a part of the 2022 UChicago Tech Community Challenge project led by Todd Tan, Yilan Liu, Patricia Zhou, Mike Wu, and Yuanyi Zhang.

To set up, simply follow the instructions below.

# Instructions 
1. Install Ruby on Rails onto your local machine via https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/getting_started.html.
2. Download chrome webdriver onto your local machine via https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
3. Create a new Ruby program to run the code for the notification bot.
4. Copy the code from this repository to your local machine.
5. Before you run the code, make the following changes: (5a) Replace "COURSE CODE" with the actual course code of your desired course. Please format it as a four letter departmental code, followed by the 5 digit course number (e.g. CMSC 15400). (5b) Replace "youremail@sender.com" to be the email you wish to get notified by.
6. After making these changes, run the code on your local machine! You should receive feedback in the terminal as it runs.
